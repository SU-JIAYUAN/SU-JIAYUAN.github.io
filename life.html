                    I love connecting with new people, and I've been fortunate to make internationl friends from various corners of the globe, including Italy, UK, Australia, Indonesia, Philippines, and so on. 
                    Music is a big part of my life, particularly ballads and pop songs. I'm a fan of singers Jay Chou, Yoga Lin, and Eric Chou. 
                    While I haven't received any awards for singing yet, it's definitely a goal of mine! 
                    Alongside my passion for music, I also prioritize my fitness, hitting the gym regularly. 
                    In the past, I used to enjoy activities like skateboarding, playing the guitar, and skiing, although it's been some time since I've done them.
