                    I enjoy meeting new people and socializing, but I'm also a bit socially anxious. 
                    I love music, especially ballads and pop songs. I'm a fan of Jay Chou, Yoga Lin, and Eric Chou. 
                    Additionally, I have a habit of working out regularly at the gym, which gives me a sense of discipline. 
                    I also enjoy learning English because I believe it's one of the keys to experiencing the world and making more friends.
                    I used to skateboard and play the guitar before, but it's been a while since I last played them.
